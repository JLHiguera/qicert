As of version 0.2.3, this tool only works under Linux and depends on Nginx and Certbot.

WARNING:

The use case for this tool is very specific. And the following behaviour explains in which way.

This tool must be run as root, and will ask the user for a domain name, its TLD, and optionally a subdomain as per the following examples show:

./qicert -d example -t net -s www

./qicert -d example -t co.uk 

./qicert --domain example --tld co.uk --subdomain www

Then, in the case for www.example.net it will create a configuration file for example.net in sites-availables, create a softlink, check or create a root folder in /var/www/www.example.net/public, add an ACME-challenge configuration block in the configuration file, reload nginx, spawn certbot to request a certificate, remove the ACME-challenge server block, add a simple http redirect and https configuration block for a given domain.

In the case a configuration file exists, it should create a backup, and append the server blocks mentioned in the previous paragraph.
