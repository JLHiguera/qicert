As of version 0.1.0, this tool only works under Linux and with Nginx and Certbot.

WARNING:
READ THE CODE BEFORE RUNNING OR BUILDING
BACKUP NGINX CONFIGURATION FILES IF NEEDED
DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION!
DO NOT USE IN CRITICAL SYSTEMS!

The use case for this tool is very specific. And the following behaviour explains in which way.

This tool will ask the user for a domain name, its TLD, and optionally a subdomain, in that specific order, as per the following examples:

./nginx_certer example net www

./nginx_certer example co.uk 

./nginx_certer example co.uk www

Then, in the case for www.example.net it will create a configuration file for example.net in sites-availables, create a softlink, check or create a root folder in /var/www/www.example.net/public, add an ACME-challenge configuration block in the configuration file, reload nginx, spawn certbot to request a certificate, remove the ACME-challenge server block, add a simple http redirect and https configuration block for a given domain.

In the case a configuration file exists, it should create a backup, and append the server blocks mentioned in the previous paragraph.
