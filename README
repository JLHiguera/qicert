As of version 0.3.0, this tool only works under Linux and depends on Nginx or Apache and Certbot.

WARNING:
READ THE CODE BEFORE RUNNING OR BUILDING
BACKUP NGINX OR APACHE CONFIGURATION FILES IF NEEDED

DO NOT USE IN CRITICAL SYSTEMS!

The use case for this tool is very specific. And the following behaviour explains in which way.

This tool must be run as root, and will ask the user for a domain name, its TLD, and optionally a subdomain as per the following examples show:

./qicert nginx -d example -t net -s www

./qicert apache -d example -t co.uk 

./qicert apache --domain example --tld co.uk --subdomain www

Then, in the case for www.example.net it will create a configuration file for example.net in sites-availables, create a softlink, check or create a root folder in /var/www/www.example.net/public, add an ACME-challenge configuration block in the configuration file, reload the webserver, spawn certbot to request a certificate, remove the ACME-challenge server block, add a simple http redirect and https configuration block for a given domain.

In the case a configuration file exists, it should create a backup, and append the server blocks mentioned in the previous paragraph.
